/* Uses to draw a line between two points with a bezier Ã©quation
Bezier curve is based on 4 control points, second and third points are calculated
from the first and fourth control points
It's a drawable object for SFML render window
Usage is :
	FBezierCurbe myBezierCurve(param ... );
	myBezierCurve.calculate();
	window.draw(myBezierCurve);

If the line curve is not calculate before draw it will not be draw
